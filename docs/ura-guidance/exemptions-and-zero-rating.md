# Exemptions and Zero-Rating

Exempt supplies and zero-rated supplies are treated differently for VAT purposes.

## Exempt Supplies

Exempt supplies generally do not attract output VAT, and input VAT recovery may be restricted.

## Zero-Rated Supplies

Zero-rated supplies are taxable at 0%, often preserving the right to claim related input VAT where statutory conditions are satisfied.

## Practical Review

Taxpayers should classify transactions carefully and document the legal basis for exemption or zero-rating treatment.
